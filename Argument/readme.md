Arguement: Given an argument about the topic, analyze its deduction and evidence's rationality.

### Example Draft

People rely on technology to solve problem -> ability to think for themselves will deteriorate

1. reason of deteriorate: do not pay effort to think(search google), calculator(less often train the mathmatics ability), convenient tools

2. rely on technology to solve problem: search->gather information(not related to thinking, but provides more ways to solve problem)

Sample answer:

Positive: 

1. Too much rely on technology, once if the technology no longer available, situation much worse 

2. Calculator, math arithmatic calculation, if you don't use it, you lose it.

Negative:

1. Developing, implementing, and applying the technology trained our thinking ability

2. Free us from monotonous and cumbersome work so that we can dedicate to more complex topic

3. Provide more information that are not available before

4. Facilitate the exchange of ideas between scholars

5. Technolgy relies on human choice(Every technology innovation is promoted by human intelligence and decision)
